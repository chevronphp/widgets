# chevron.widgets

Chevron aims to be a 'simple set of useful tools'. This means that it
exists as a humble collection of code I've written and found quite useful.

Chevron.widgets is a simple view/templating system. It's designed to allow for
an OO interface for the scoped inclusion a file (as PHP) while allowing scoped
access to specific data. It also allows for the use of a callable as a file,
meaning that the "included" template could simply be a function.

# usage

If there isn't an examples dir, look through the tests.

# installation

Using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) `"require" : { "henderjon/chevron-widgets": "2.*" }`

# where is version 1.*?

Packagist (an important component to the composer ecosystem) prefers dashes as separators (I was
using dots). I had to update all the package names accordingly.

# license
