# chevron.widgets [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/henderjon/chevron.widgets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/henderjon/chevron.widgets)

A simple view/templating system. It's designed to allow for
an OO interface for the scoped inclusion a file (as PHP) while allowing scoped
access to specific data. It also allows for the use of a callable as a file,
meaning that the "included" template could simply be a function.

# usage

# installation

Using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) `"require" : { "henderjon/chevron-widgets": "~2.0" }`
