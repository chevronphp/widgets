## chevron.widgets

A simple view/templating system. It's designed to allow for
an OO interface for the scoped inclusion a file (as PHP) while allowing scoped
access to specific data. It also allows for the use of a callable as a file,
meaning that the "included" template could simply be a function.

Peruse the tests or, if present, the examples directory to see usage.

See [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/henderjon/chevron-widgets) for version/installation info. At the moment, I recommend using `~2.0`.
